### Intro
So you just purchased a 3D Printer, let's quickly go over how it works, how it's different than other CNC machines, and why it's so cool!

### How does it work?
There are two main types of 3D Printers today:
- FDM - Fused Deposition Modeling
  - material is deposited in single layers that fuse together to create a 3D object.
- SLA - Stereolithography
  - a high-powered laser is used to harden liquid resin that is contained in a reservoir to create a 3D object.

### How is it different than other CNC machines?
3D Printing is an additive manufacturing method as opposed to other CNC machines such as a CNC mill which is a subtractive manufacturing method. The difference being additive manufacturing creates an object from nothing by slowly adding layers together and subtractive manufacturing creates an object from a solid block of material by slowly subtracting layers.
### Why?
Rapid Prototyping
  - The ability to go from an idea to a physical object that you can hold in your hand and test fit on your project in a matter of hours has unmatched potential

Inexpensive
  - The day of affordable consumer 3D Printers is here! Not only are the printers themselves affordable but 1kg worth of printing material costs $20 on average
