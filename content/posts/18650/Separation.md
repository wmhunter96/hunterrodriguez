### Intro:
So now you have a bunch of cells, how do you separate the good ones from the bad ones? The usable ones, from the unusable ones?

### Charger/Discharger 1-6 Cells:
There are many ways to tell good cells from bad cells, if you're on a budget you accomplish this step with a simple multimeter. However, I highly recommend a charger/discharger for 1-6 cells such as the IMAX B6, or the IMAX B6 mini. That being said any charger/discharger can be used. Recently I have really been liking the LiitoKala, so look around and do your research.

### Separating:

The first/initial test that I run to separate the good cells from the bad cells is to simply test the voltage of each cell. If any given cell is below 1-2v, I recycle the cell responsibly at my nearest convenience. Some 1v cells can be saved but in reality, however, these cells shouldn't drop below 3.2v, so 1v is very low. I usually use 2v as my cutt-off voltage.
