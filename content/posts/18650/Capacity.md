### Intro:
Now you have a bunch of "good" cells what do you do now? The next step is to test exactly how good each cell is.

### Charging:
The first step in testing how good a cell is, is to charge it. This is where the IMAX B6 or the LiitoKala comes in really handy. Use your Charger of choice to charge each of the cells that you have deemed to be usable. The cutt-off voltage for a typical 18650 is about 4.2v.

### Rest (optional):
It is recommended to let the cells rest for a period of time before proceeding. However this step is not completely necessary if you are in a rush. If you choose to do this step, let your cells rest for a period of time (7-60 days) and then check the voltage again. If the voltage has dropped a significant amount, this means that this cell has some sort of self discharge habit. These cells can be placed with the other cells determined to be unusable. Set aside for further recycling.

### Discharge:
After the cells are fully charged it is time to fully discharge them and get a capacity reading. The IMAX B6 and LiitoKala do an excellent job at doing this for you. However, this is still possible to accomplish with a simple multimeter. The capacity of a cell in Amp Hours is determined by the load in Amps divided by the amount of time it can supply the load for in hours. By this logic you can use resistors with the equivalent of 1 or 2 Amps and time how long it takes before the cell gets to its minimum voltage of about 3.2v from its maximum voltage of about 4.2v. Divide the load in Amps by the amount of time in hours and you have the capacity of your cell in Ah (Amp Hours).

### Retest (optional):
For a more accurate measure of a cell's capacity it is recommended to charge and discharge in this manner more than one time to confirm the capacity.
