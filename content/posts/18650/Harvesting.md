### Intro:
So you want to harvest 18650 cells. 18650 cells are readily available and commonly found in most laptop batteries as well as power-tool battery packs. With an average voltage of 3.7V per cell and capacities ranging from .5Ah - 3Ah, these cells are very versatile and suitable for most of your projects in need of battery power.

### Where to find 18650 cells:
So, I'm going to let you guys in on a little secret. From my findings, about 70-80% of cells from "bad" or "dead" laptop batteries are actually perfectly good cells that you can work with. This is where the harvesting comes in, you can find recycled laptop batteries all over the place. Most commonly found on eBay in lots or at flee markets or garage sales. Not only that, it is not just laptop batteries that you can harvest from; power-tool battery packs, and some flashlights, as well as vapes all use 18650 cells. I'll leave finding the packs up to you.

### How do I get the cells out?:

#### Methods:

**1) The Twist Method**

The twist method works best on long skinny laptop batteries. The twist method will not work every time, but it is an easy first method to try. To perform the twist method, you guessed it, all you have to do is twist. Now, you do have to twist pretty hard, so don't be afraid to get rough with it. Breaking plastic is a good sign! WARNING!: do not attempt the twist method on packs that are not long and skinny. Some packs are more square shaped (ie. power-tool battery pack) and the twist method should not be attempted in these cases. Gloves are recommended.

**2) The Sticker Method**

In some cases there is a sticker that you can easily remove that gives you super easy access to the cells inside and greatly aids you in getting inside of the pack. As sometimes it is quite difficult. Use the opening that the sticker reveals to gain leverage and rip open the plastic casing.

**3) The Pry Method**

If all else fails and you simply can not get this stupid thing open you resort to the pry method. To perform the pry method, get yourself a thin flat head screwdriver or a knife and look for weak points in the structure, typically corners or similar places and pry the thing apart. This can take a lot of effort and be very tedious. However! it is PARAMOUNT that you understand that when using this method to use EXTREME CARE as puncturing cells can result in very high temperatures and even explosions, use extreme care when using sharp tools.


### Remove the BMS (Battery Management System):
The next step is to remove the BMS, the BMS looks is that circuit board that is attached to your cells. Just cut it off with scissors or wire cutters.

### Remove Excess Nickel Strip:
Now remove the excess nickel strip revealing the bare cells. If you are planning on re-using a large amount of these cells, consider saving the nickel as you can melt it down and re-use it later.

### Profit!
