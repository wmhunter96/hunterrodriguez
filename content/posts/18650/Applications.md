### Intro:
So now that you have a bunch of good 18650 cells with confirmed capacities what can you do with them?

### Battery Packs:
The main thing that you can do with these cells is turn them into battery packs. Creating battery packs out of your cells will allow you to achieve greater voltages if combined in series, and greater capacities if combined in parallel. Battery packs have many uses, including:
1. Portable Charger - combined with a 5$ chip from amazon, a 18650 battery pack becomes a portable charger for your phone and other usb devices.
2. Electric Vehicles - 18650's are a good option for most electric vehicles from electric skateboards to even Tesla cars use 18650 cells.

### Profit!
